# express-sequelize-session-example

A starting point for an Express app that uses:

- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session)
- [connect-session-sequelize](https://github.com/mweibel/connect-session-sequelize)

I did not get the `sync` functionality of connect-session-sequelize to work.
